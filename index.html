          Teaching the Places in Cities with Google Earth Studio <br />

        </h1>
        <p class="lead">
          The goals of this activity are to help the students learn the
          different places in cities and teach them about the differences
          between cities in Spain and those in foreign, English-speaking
          countries, like Melbourne, Australia. The primary digital resource is
          a presentation made with Google Earth Studio that gives them an
          animated audio-visual tour of a city. This presentation is
          complemented by a quiz and homework assignment that serve to reinforce
          children's learning of the associated vocabulary and the
          similarities/differences between how urban areas are in Spain and
          other countries.

        <h2>Lesson Plan</h2>
        <p>
          This lesson requires about 90 minutes, which is the length of one and
          a half classes at my assigned school. It is divided into two main
          parts:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>the presentation</li>
          <li>the homework assignment</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The presentation part is done first and takes 50 minutes. The
          remaining 10 minutes of that class are dedicated to introducing the
          homework assignment to the students. During the next class the
          students present their homework assignments to their peers for 30
          minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          This lesson is given towards the end of the "places in cities" unit;
          before the end of unit test, but after the bulk of new vocabulary and
          grammar has been introduced by the teacher. It is intended as a more
          practical activity that helps the students to reinforce what they have
          learnt and the teacher to get a better idea of which children need
          additional support before they are tested more formally.
        </p>
        <h3 class="pt-2">Part 1: A Tour of Melbourne</h3>
        <h4>The Presentation</h4>
        <p>
          The presentation consists of various photos and animated videos that
          are used to give a virtual tour of the city of Melbourne to the
          students in order to help them learn about the different parts of a
          city as well as some of the cultural differences between Spain and
          Australia. It takes about 40 minutes to present the entire thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the animated videos, the camera flies around the city to focus on
          its features, such as train stations, newsagencies, town halls, police
          stations, etc. As the camera reaches a destination, a higher quality
          photo of that place with a caption, naming it in English, is shown to
          the children. At each destination I talk a little about what you can
          do at this place or why it is an important part of the city. The
          students are allowed (and encouraged) to raise their hands to ask
          questions or make comments at each stop of the tour.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two parts of the presentation that got the most interest from the
          students were the sports stadiums, due to the "exotic" sports like
          cricket and Australian football that are played there, and the
          influence that England has had on Australia, such as with many
          landmarks being named after members of the British royal family.
        </p>
        <h5>Keynote</h5>
        <p>
          The presentation that I made for this lesson is embedded below. Note
          that the videos, sound effects, and animations do not play in the
          embedded version. For the complete experience you should download it
          to your computer.

        </div>
        <h4>The Quiz</h4>
        <p>
          The quiz is done immediately after the presentation and consists of
          seven questions based around the presentation and the associated
          vocabulary of the unit. It is intended to take about 10 minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first five questions are easier and are asked to the entire class,
          with students raising their hands if they want to answer. The last two
          questions are more opened ended and a little more time should be
          allocated to them than to the others. For some classes these last two
          questions are better answered when the children work in their table
          groups.
        </p>
        <p>The questions from the quiz are:</p>
        <ul class="font-italic">
          <li>Where can people in Melbourne go to relax in their free time?</li>
          <li>
            Where can artistic people go in Melbourne? What would they see
            there?
          </li>
          <li>
            What kinds of things can tourists do when they visit Melbourne?
          </li>
          <li>How can children travel to school in Melbourne?</li>
          <li>
            Where can people play sport in Melbourne? What kinds of sports are
            popular there?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="font-italic">
          <li>What similarities are there between Melbourne and Madrid?</li>
          <li>What differences are there between Melbourne and Madrid?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          After the set questions have been answered, the other questions that
          the students have about the presentation can be asked if there is
          time.
        </p>
        <h3 class="pt-2">Part 2: Creating a Tour of Your City</h3>
        <p>
          The second part of this lesson is a homework assignment that consists
          of the students working in groups of around four to create a tour of
          their city/neighbourhood. During the next class, once their assignment
          has been completed, they present it in groups to their peers. This
          part of the assignment is intended to get the students to practice
          using the vocabulary and grammar they learned in the unit, as well as
          to make them more conscious of the environment they live in.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the homework assigment is basically in an identical format to the
          presentation they have already seen, they should feel comfortable that
          they know what they are required to do.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each group should plan to present for 5 minutes. By giving the
          students time to prepare and work with their friends, the less skilled
          kids will feel more confident when it comes to speaking English in
          front of their classmates.
        </p>

      <section id="digital-resources" class="pt-5">
        <h2>Digital Resources</h2>
        <p>
          The main technology used in this lesson was
          <a href="https://www.google.com/earth/studio/">Google Earth Studio</a
          >, which is a web app that allows you to create animations using the
          satellite imagery and 3D data from Google Earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          An example movie I made with Google Earth Studio can be seen below. It
          begins at the State Library of Victoria and ends at the Melbourne
          Cricket Ground.

        </div>
        <p>
          These sorts of videos are useful digital resources for this unit
          because they are much more engaging than static images. When you show
          a series of photos taken around a city they feel disconnected and it
          is difficult to figure out where each place is in relation to the
          others, especially if you haven't been there in person before.
          Animated videos such as these help to alleviate these problems and
          allow for a significantly more fluid experience because we get to see
          what is happening between each of the points of interest.
        </p>
        <h3>Using Google Earth Studio</h3>
        <p>
          You create animations in Google Earth Studio by setting keyframes.
          This means that you choose the start and end points of the desired
          animation on the map, then the programme animates a smooth transition
          between them. Combined with the simple user interface, this makes it
          relatively easy to create cool videos.
        </p>
        <p>
          Google Earth Studio requires the Google Chrome web browser and an
          internet connection. The animations are rendered locally so using a
          more powerful computer results in a better experience as a user. As
          the programme is currently in beta, it currently only exports
          animations frame by frame (i.e. you download a bunch of images rather
          than a video), so you need to stitch the frames together into a movie
          yourself. There are many programmes that will do this for you; I used
          <a href="https://www.apple.com/es/final-cut-pro/compressor/"
            >Compressor</a
          >.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Other Potential Applications of Google Earth Studio in Primary
          Education
        </h3>
        <p>
          I think that Google Earth Studio animations would complement the
          teaching of some of the other units that the students at my school
          have been studying.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some classes have been studying giving and receiving directions in
          English. Similar videos could be used to make illustrate a journey
          that the students have to transcribe as instructions to recreate the
          route. Others have been studying natural wonders and geographical
          features. Simple animations such as the one below of Ayer's Rock in
          Australia could complement the teaching of this.
