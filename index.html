          The goals of this activity are to help the students learn the
          different places in cities and teach them about the differences
          between cities in Spain and those in foreign, English-speaking
          countries, like Melbourne, Australia. The primary digital resource is
          a presentation made with Google Earth Studio that gives them an
          animated audio-visual tour of a city. This presentation is
          complemented by a quiz that serves reinforce children's learning of
          the associated vocabulary and the similarities/differences between how
          urban areas are in Spain and other countries.

        <h4>The Presentation</h4>
        <p>Presentation</p>
        <h5>Final Presentation</h5>
        <p>
          The final version of the presentation that I made for this lesson is
          embedded below. Note that the videos, sound effects, and animations do
          not play in the embedded version. For the best experience you should
          download it to your computer.

            class="embed-responsive-item pb-3"

          ></iframe>
        </div>
        <h4>The Quiz</h4>
        <p>
          The quiz is done immediately after the presentation and consists of
          seven questions based around the presentation and the associated
          vocabulary of the unit. It is intended to take between five to ten
          minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first five questions are easier and are asked to the entire class,
          with students raising their hands if they want to answer. The last two
          questions are more opened ended and a little more time should be
          allocated to them than to the others. For some classes these last two
          questions are better answered when the children work in their table
          groups.
        </p>
        <p>The questions from the quiz are:</p>
        <ul class="font-italic">
          <li>Where can people in Melbourne go to relax in their free time?</li>
          <li>
            Where can artistic people go in Melbourne? What would they see
            there?
          </li>
          <li>
            What kinds of things can tourists do when they visit Melbourne?
          </li>
          <li>How can children travel to school in Melbourne?</li>
          <li>
            Where can people play sport in Melbourne? What kinds of sports are
            popular there?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="font-italic">
          <li>What similarities are there between Melbourne and Madrid?</li>
          <li>What differences are there between Melbourne and Madrid?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Digital Resources</h2>
        <p>
          The main technology used in this lesson was
          <a href="https://www.google.com/earth/studio/">Google Earth Studio</a
          >, which is a web app that allows you to create animations using the
          satellite imagery and 3D data from Google Earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          An example movie I made with Google Earth Studio can be seen below. It
          begins at the State Library of Victoria and ends at the Melbourne
          Cricket Ground.
        </p>
        <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
          <iframe
            class="embed-responsive-item pb-3"
            src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dkl7k559AzE"
            referrer="no-referrer"
            allow="accelerometer; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
            allowfullscreen
          ></iframe>
        </div>
        <p>These sorts of videos are useful digital resources because</p>
        <h3>Using Google Earth Studio</h3>
        <p>
          You create animations in Google Earth Studio by setting keyframes.
          This means that you choose the start and end points of the desired
          animation on the map, then the programme animates a smooth transition
          between them. Combined with the simple user interface, this makes it
          relatively easy to create cool videos.
        </p>
        <p>
          Google Earth Studio requires the Google Chrome web browser and an
          internet connection. The animations are rendered locally so using a
          more powerful computer results in a better experience as a user. As
          the programme is currently in beta, it currently only exports
          animations frame by frame (i.e. you download a bunch of images rather
          than a video), so you need to stitch the frames together into a movie
          yourself. There are many programmes that will do this for you; I used
          <a href="https://www.apple.com/es/final-cut-pro/compressor/"
            >Compressor</a
          >.
        </p>
        <h3>Other Potential Applications of Google Earth Studio in Primary Education</h3>
        <p>
          I think that Google Earth Studio animations would complement the
          teaching of some of the other units that the students at my school
          have been studying.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some classes have been studying giving and receiving directions in
          English. Similar videos could be used to make illustrate a journey
          that the students have to transcribe as instructions to recreate the
          route. Others have been studying natural wonders and geographical
          features. Simple animations such as the one below of Ayer's Rock in
          Australia could complement the teaching of this.
