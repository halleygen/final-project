# Teaching the Places in Cities with Google Earth Studio

Primary Education (4th Grade)

## Summary

The goals of this activity are to help the students learn the different places in cities and teach them about the differences between cities in Spain and those in foreign, English-speaking countries, like Melbourne, Australia. The primary digital resource is a presentation made with Google Earth Studio that gives them an animated audio-visual tour of a city. This presentation is complemented by a quiz and homework assignment that serve to reinforce children's learning of the associated vocabulary and the similarities/differences between how urban areas are in Spain and other countries.
